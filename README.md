In the above paper, we have developed an algorithm for a free-breathing and ungated cardiac MRI scheme using an iterative kernel low-
rank algorithm and self-gated spiral sequence.

Main benefits:

The  iterative  SToRM  algorithm  facilitates  the  extension  of  manifold  regularization  to
navigator-less spiral acquisitions, thus improving sampling efficiency. The proposed scheme eliminates
the need for breath-holding and ECG gating, while facilitating the imaging of the cardiac function in
different respiratory phases.
